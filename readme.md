Sworn is a promise library based on Promises/A+ specification and other features.

The Promises/A+ specification includes a object `Promise` with a function `then` with the signature 
`promise.then(onFulfilled, onRejected)`. Read more about it on [MDN][mdn-promise-then] and [Promises/A+](https://promisesaplus.com/).
- onFullfilled: `(value) -> void`
- onRejected: `(reason) -> void`

Other than the specification there are there are `catch` and `fail` (`promise.[catch|fail](onRejected)`) which are just a shorthand 
for `promise.then(onFulfilled, onRejected)`.

`Promise.all(array)` that takes a array of promises (can be mixed with regular values). And resolves all of them in parallel and 
resolves the array to the next then call.

`Promise.race(array)` that takes a array of promises (can be mixed with regular values). And resolves the first one to be done.

This library was a product of a school project about JavaScript optimization. As I am not great at writing it is kind of short but.
